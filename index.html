<blockquote>
<p>G: Let's watch a movie!<br>
B: Sure! What movie would you like to see?<br>
G: Dunno! Let's find something from IMDB.<br>
B: OK!<br><em>B and G open IMDB.com</em><br>
G: This one looks fun! But I don't feel like watching sci-fi tonight. Let's put it on our Watch Later list.<br>
B: I found a good one! But it's a bit too long. I'll add it to the Watch Later list.<br><em>2 hours later with 20 movies in the Watch Later list</em><br>
B: I give up!<br>
G: Picking the perfect movie is really hard!<br>
B <em>and</em> G <em>at the same time</em>: If only there was a simple, easy to use command line program that would pick out a semi-random movie from our Watch Later list!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that exchange sounded familiar, you are in the right place!
Coin is a command-line utility that chooses a semi-random movie from a previously compiled list.
Movies can be added by title, IMDB address or themoviedb.org URL.
Coin uses themoviedb.org as it's backend for downloading metadata.</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h3>

<p>Coin puts all unwatched movies from your list into a general pool and draws a semi-random choice from there.
Not all movies have the same likelihood of being selected.
The probability of a movie being drawn from the pool is proportional to the movie's rating.
A movie with a rating of 10.0 is about twice as likely to be chosen as one with a rating of 5.0.</p>

<p>It seemed like a semi-sensible design choice.</p>

<h2>
<a name="requirements-and-installation" class="anchor" href="#requirements-and-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements and installation</h2>

<p>Coin uses <code>json</code>, <code>themoviedb</code>, <code>colorize</code> and <code>trollop</code> gems.
You can install them with</p>

<pre><code>gem install json themoviedb colorize trollop
</code></pre>

<p>There is no special installation procedure for coin.
If you want to make your life easier, copy <code>coin.rb</code> to a folder that is in your <code>$PATH</code> and rename it to <code>coin</code>.
Coin will create a database file called <code>.coindb.json</code> in your home directory.</p>
