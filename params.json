Let's find something from IMDB.  \r\n> B: OK!  \r\n> *B and G open IMDB.com*  \r\n> G: This one looks fun! But I don't feel like watching sci-fi tonight. Let's put it on our Watch Later list.  \r\n> B: I found a good one! But it's a bit too long. I'll add it to the Watch Later list.  \r\n> *2 hours later with 20 movies in the Watch Later list*  \r\n> B: I give up!  \r\n> G: Picking the perfect movie is really hard!  \r\n> B *and* G *at the same time*: If only there was a simple, easy to use command line program that would pick out a semi-random movie from our Watch Later list!  \r\n\r\nIf that exchange sounded familiar, you are in the right place!\r\nCoin is a command-line utility that chooses a semi-random movie from a previously compiled list.\r\nMovies can be added by title, IMDB address or themoviedb.org URL.\r\nCoin uses themoviedb.org as it's backend for downloading metadata.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nCoin puts all unwatched movies from your list into a general pool and draws a semi-random choice from there.\r\nNot all movies have the same likelihood of being selected.\r\nThe probability of a movie being drawn from the pool is proportional to the movie's rating.\r\nA movie with a rating of 10.0 is about twice as likely to be chosen as one with a rating of 5.0.\r\n\r\n### Why semi-random and not plain old random?\r\nIt seemed like a semi-sensible design choice.\r\n\r\n## Requirements and installation\r\n\r\nCoin uses `json`, `themoviedb`, `colorize` and `trollop` gems.\r\nYou can install them with\r\n\r\n    gem install json themoviedb colorize trollop\r\n\r\nThere is no special installation procedure for coin.\r\nIf you want to make your life easier, copy `coin.rb` to a folder that is in your `$PATH` and rename it to `coin`.\r\nCoin will create a database file called `.coindb.json` in your home directory.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n    \tcoin [action] <argument(s)>\r\n    \r\n\tActions:\r\n    \tadd, a         Add a new movie to the database. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t   Arguments can be movie titles, IMDB addresses \r\n\t\t\t\t\t   (www.imdb.com/title/<IDMB ID>) or TMDb addresses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   (www.themoviedb.org/movie/<TMDb ID>). If the title \r\n\t\t\t\t\t   contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   (e.g. coin add \"Kung Fu Panda\")\r\n    \tdelete, d      Delete a movie from the database. Arguments are\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   movie IDs (TMDb IDs) that are displayed by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \"list\" command\r\n    \tflip, f        Get a semi-random movie from the database\r\n    \tlist, l        List all movies in the database\r\n    \timport, i      Import movies from a file that contains one movie\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   title/IMDB URL/TMDb URL per line.
